#AVL Tree

#An avl tree is a self balancing binary search tree where difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than
#1 for all nodes

#Why we need an AVL tree
#to avoid the skewness of the BST where the search complexity might become O(n)
#To convert sorted array into BST height balanced is an AVL tree
