- unordered , changeable and indexed
- dictionary are indexed by key
- implemented by hash function
- Key ---> hash function ---> index --> the value is stored at this index in array (no need to traverse the dict when you know a key)
- Time complxity to access data = O(1)
- dictionary are mutable
- list allows duplicates whereas dictionary does not allow.

**Deleting and inserting a value in dictionary has O(1) time complexity as compared to list which is O(n) (as we need to move elements in memory)**
