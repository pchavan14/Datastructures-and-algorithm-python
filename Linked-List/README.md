- consists of head , nodes and tail
- each element consists of data and link to next node
- linked list is not stored contiguosly 
- head is used for locating the linked list
- tail helps to insert element at tail so increase the efficieny so we avoid traversing the whole linked list
- random access in arrays is more efficient , in linked list we need to traverse the linked list

**Types of Linked List**
- singly linked list
- circular singly linked list - last node contains the reference of first node
- doubly linked list -  two references to each node , previous and next node
- circular doubly linked list - two references to each node , previous and next node and last node stores address of first node.
