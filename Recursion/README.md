## Recursion 
- making the problem smaller and smaller , base condition is needed to stop the recursion
- The method calls itself and exit from infite loop
- we return a value when we are storing recursion value in a variable
- Recursive algortihms is not space efficient whereas Iteration is space efficicient
- Recursion is not time efficient whereas Iteration is time efficicient
- Recursion is easy to implement 
- memoization in recursion reduces time complexity

## Points to be noted
Recursion needs 3 steps tp work
- Find the recursive conditions
- Find the base condition
- Find the constraints or probability of errors
