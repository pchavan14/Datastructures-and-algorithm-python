- sequence of values and are immutable (we cannot change it)
- tuples are also comparable and hashable
- elements of tuples are stored in contiguos memory
- we can reasign tuple, but cannot delete element from tuples
- we can have nested tuples 
- iterating through a tuples is faster than with list.
