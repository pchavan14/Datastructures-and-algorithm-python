Time complexity 
- A way of showing how the runtime of a function increases as the size of input increases
- We calculate the number of operations

Space complexity
- The amount of memory some code uses

Big O Notations (worst case scenario)
Omega (bext case scenario)
Theta (average case scenario)

Complexity  Name            Sample
O(1)        Constant        Simple add numbers functions
O(N)        Linear          Loop through numbers 1 to n
O(LogN)     Logarithmic     Find any element in sorted array
O(N^2)      Quadratic       Nested loops
O(2^N)      Exponential     Double recursion in Fibonacci
